# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO Crossy.py

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO A game where an animal crosses the road. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO My project is based off a video game Crossey Road where a certain type of animal needs to cross a road or two in order for a player to win. If the animal gets hit by a moving vehicle on the road, then the animal will die and the player will lose.  

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable
Name: Brandon Hyde
TA: Elmira Talebianaraki Section 001
Email: tut32116@temple.edu

Name: Rahul Basnet
TA: Elmira Talebianaraki Section 001
Email: tut53805@temple.edu


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO  A good outcome for my project is knowing on how to properly use if and else statements. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO A better outcome for my final project is knowing how to get and use different type of image files in my program. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO The best outcome for my final project is making the best version of the Crossey Road Video Game.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO  There are multiple skills that I need to acquire in order to make the best project. First, I need to find research on how to properly use a certain image file in order to make the character that the user will control during the game. This type of topic will also make me learn on how to create different vehicle shapes as obstacle courses for the player. Next, I will also need to learn on what other modules are being used and their functions in the python language program. I have 2 friends working with me in this final project. One classmate will do research with the coding process of this program. The other classmate will search and gather all of the files and images needed for this final project. I will do the fixes of any errors found in my program and assist my classmates with the coding and searching for the files. This will make my final program to show the best version of the Video Game.
